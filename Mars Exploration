A space explorer's ship crashed on Mars! They send a series of SOS messages to Earth for help.
Letters in some of the SOS messages are altered by cosmic radiation during transmission. 
Given the signal received by Earth as a string, s, determine how many letters of the SOS message have been changed by radiation.

Example

s = "SOSTOT"
The original message was SOSSOS. Two of the message's characters were changed in transit.

Function Description

Complete the marsExploration function in the editor below.

marsExploration has the following parameter(s):

string s: the string as received on Earth
Returns

int: the number of letters changed during transmission

*/

func marsExploration(s: String) -> Int {
    var n = 0
    let str = "SOTDUYFHKVBM"
    for i in stride(from: 0, to: s.count, by: 3) {
        if s[s.index(s.startIndex, offsetBy: i)] != "S" {
            n += 1
        }
        if s[s.index(s.startIndex, offsetBy: i + 1)] != "O" {
            n += 1
        }
        if s[s.index(s.startIndex, offsetBy: i + 2)] != "S" {
            n += 1
        }
    }
    
    return n

}
